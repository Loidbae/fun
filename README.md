# fun

Make any game using your any idea, now with 50% less pressure and 75% less spagetthi code.

## What it's all about

fun is an open-source approach to making an accessible, easy to use, yet powerful programming framework to assist game development. We accomplish this by generally defining the structure of a game, making you focus on what's really important. No longer will you spend unneccessary time coding small features that are easily implementable using this framework. Instead you'll find yourself developing a proper program structure that's changeable and scaleable.
